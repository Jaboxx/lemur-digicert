lemur-digicert
==============

DigiCert Plugin for [Lemur](https://github.com/Netflix/lemur)

This plugin provides Issuer support for the DigiCert v2.0 API.
The plugin supports both standard and private SSL certificate types, and
will choose between "SSL Plus" and "SSL Multi-Domain" depending on whether
SANs are present or not.

Setup
-----
To install the plugin, add the following lines to your lemur.conf.py file:
```python
# DigiCert Plugin (CertCentral, API v2)
DIGICERT_URL = 'https://www.digicert.com/services/v2'
DIGICERT_ACCOUNT_ID = (your account ID)
DIGICERT_API_KEY = (your API key)
DIGICERT_REQUEST_TYPE = ['SSL_PLUS' | 'PRIVATE_SSL_PLUS'] (choose one)
DIGICERT_ORG_ID = (your DigiCert org ID)
DIGICERT_CA_CERT_ID = (only required for PRIVATE_SSL_PLUS)
DIGICERT_SIGNATURE_HASH = 'sha256'
```

Deploy and install the files. For example, using Docker, you can add the
following lines to your Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Install DigiCert Plugin
ADD lemur_digicert /usr/local/src/lemur/lemur_digicert
RUN cd /usr/local/src/lemur/lemur_digicert &&\
  pip install -e .
```

You may also want to adjust the timeout value when starting the API, since
DigiCert occasionally takes several minutes to process the cert request
before allowing download. We have ours set to 10 minutes:
```bash
python manage.py start --timeout 600 ...
```

Go to the Authorities section of Lemur and add a new entry for DigiCert, choosing
DigiCert from the Plugin dropdown.

Usage
-----
You can request certs as usual using Lemur, just select the DigiCert certificate authority during creation!
